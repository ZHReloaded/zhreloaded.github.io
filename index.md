<h3> The Horde has come once again!</h3>
<p>Welcome all survivors, to the new world order! Zombie Horde: Reloaded is a revival of the original Zombie Horde for Counter-Strike: Source. This gamemode sees survivors pit against the horde, a group of fast, aggressive zombies. The only means of survival is co-operative teamwork against the zombies, with each player fully utilising the weapons available to them.</p>
<p>Zombie Horde: Reloaded is currently in closed beta, with plans to be released very soon. Don't get too excited!</p>
