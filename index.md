<h3> The Horde has come once again!</h3>
<p>Welcome all survivors, to the new world order! Zombie Horde: Reloaded is a revival of the original Zombie Horde for Counter-Strike: Source. This gamemode sees survivors pit against the horde, a group of fast, aggressive zombies. The only means of survival is co-operative teamwork against the zombies, with each player fully utilising the weapons available to them.</p>
<p>Zombie Horde: Reloaded is currently in closed beta, with plans to be released very soon. Don't get too excited!</p>

Welcome to the zombie horde: reloaded website! The development of this project has currently been suspended indefinitely, until I can find the free time to work on it. I'm currently finishing up my degree in Uni which has taken a lot of my free time up for the past year. Maybe next year ay? 

P.S. this website actually looks like rubbish; It's been a year since I updated it and by my now higher standards, it really doesn't look too good... I'll have to give it a makeover when development begins again :D
