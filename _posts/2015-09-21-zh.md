<h3>{{page.title}}</h3>
<p>Zombie Horde: Reloaded is chock full of zombies, weapons and powerups, each with their own configurations, down to the littlest of details. This section of the site aims to shed some light on just how each and every element of the gamemode functions.</p>
<h4>Zombies</h4>
<p>By default there are three different NPC zombies included in Zombie Horde: Reloaded, with an extra zombie type available exclusively to players. Each zombie has particular stats and attack types, which change how they affect gameplay. Each zombie's information can be accessed by clicking on their portrait below.</p>

<h4>Weapons</h4>
<p>Included with the gamemode are 29 weapons to fight against the scores of the undead. As the original Zombie Horde: Reloaded was a Counter-Strike: Source mod, almost all of these weapons, with the exception of some of the grenades, are based heavily on their CS:S counterparts. In order to emulate the mod as closely as possible, the weapons have similar damage values, recoil and clip sizes.</p>


<h4>Powerups</h4>
<p>During the course of a round of Zombie Horde: Reloaded, a zombie may lay an egg. Once these eggs are laid, they will sit idly until a survivor comes into contact with them, upon which the survivor will be granted a powerup. Powerups range from health restoration to ammo modifiers to speed boosts to berserk mode. There's plenty of powerups and each of them will help turn the tides of battle for the survivors</p>
