    <p>The Charple zombie is the most common of the zombie types. This bugger is quick but he's weak too, relying on his lack of overall body mass to close the distance on his prey.</p>
    <h4>Behaviour</h4>
    <p>These zombies specialise in getting up in your face, keeping you busy and distracted while the other zombies attempt to play catch up. These zombies generally have no regard for their lives, and are looking to simply tack on a few quick hits before they perish.</p>
    <h4>Biology</h4>
    <p>As previously stated, for what these zombies lack in muscle density, they make up for in agility. The charple takes full advantage of it's lean frame to reach max speeds and chase down any tasty looking survivors.</p>
    <h4>Relationships</h4> 
    <p>In response to this almost suicidal behaviour, the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/information/zh/classic">Classic Zombie</a> has taken to eating the heads of his fallen comrades, using the many littered Charple heads to bolster its strength. Should a classic zombie eat enough heads, they will be able to outspeed the Charples, but hit a <i>whole</i> lot harder.</p>
